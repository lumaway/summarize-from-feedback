It's been almost a week and I'm having a terribly hard time accepting and getting over it. She truly was the love of my life and she showed me show much love, kindness, and compassion that I never got out of any of my past relationships. I ended up leaving school for the weekend and going home. Which was good for me. I got away from everything that was bothering me, and I got to spend some time with some old high school friends that I haven't seen in a long time. Later on that night, she texts me. Just \\\"Hey\\\", but it kinda confused me. She was the one who called off the relationship. When I asked her why she did, she wasn't sure why she was feeling this way, but she said \\\"I don't think I want to be in a serious relationship right now\\\" Anyway, I don't text her back for about three hours because I was busy and didn't want to fall into a the depression I was trying to avoid. I later found out through a mutual friend that she was confused as to why I hadn't texted her back earlier. When I did text her back, we didn't talk about the break up or the relationship, just what I was doing at that time. Over that last few days I've really been struggling trying to keep it all together. All I can think about is getting her back, and I will do anything for that opportunity. I haven't been talking to her, kind of avoiding her, although it's hard at times since we are the same major and live in the same building. I truly love her and like I said, I would do anything to be back together with her. We made each other happy, and I know we can do it again.\\n\\nTL;DR:\",\n",
